/**
 * Post-write refresh — host-side implementation for web-v2's
 * `Experimental_Agent` path.
 *
 * [Phase 6.5 / SPEC_V07C_PHASE_6_5_CHAT_PARITY C.1 / S.198 — 2026-05-20]
 *
 * --- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ---
 *
 * `STATIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT` line 87 promises:
 *
 *   > The engine AUTOMATICALLY re-runs balance_check / savings_info /
 *   > health_check after every successful write — fresh tool results
 *   > appear in your context BEFORE you narrate.
 *
 * That promise is delivered by the engine's `AISDKEngine` via
 * `EngineConfig.postWriteRefresh` + the `onStepFinish` hook
 * (`packages/engine/src/v2/engine.ts` L17 + L652) which intercepts the
 * step boundary and injects pre-canned read tool_results.
 *
 * **Web-v2 does NOT use `AISDKEngine`.** Per BENEFITS_SPEC_v07c §D-15,
 * web-v2 uses `Experimental_Agent` directly so the host can compose
 * audric-specific middleware (guards, PII redaction, telemetry, etc.)
 * around AI SDK primitives. The legacy engine's postWriteRefresh
 * mechanism is NOT reachable on this path.
 *
 * Without this module the static system prompt is **lying** about the
 * refresh contract — the LLM narrates the post-write paragraph using
 * STALE pre-write balance numbers from the `<financial_context>`
 * snapshot, re-opening the hallucination class that the daily
 * orientation cron specifically tries to close.
 *
 * --- IMPLEMENTATION ---
 *
 * Audric's confirm-tier writes execute CLIENT-side (sponsored-tx) and
 * land back via `addToolOutput` on the resume turn. So in web-v2 the
 * natural place to fire refresh reads is at the START of the resume
 * turn, BEFORE invoking `agent.stream(...)`:
 *
 *   1. `extractWritesNeedingRefresh(messages)` — walk the LAST
 *      assistant message's parts. For each tool part in state
 *      `output-available` whose `toolName` is a key in
 *      `POST_WRITE_REFRESH_MAP`, return its `{toolName}`.
 *      `output-error` parts are skipped — failed writes don't change
 *      on-chain state, so refreshing would just surface unchanged data
 *      (mirrors the engine's `success` check).
 *
 *   2. `dispatchPostWriteRefresh(...)` — for each refresh read in
 *      the union of `POST_WRITE_REFRESH_MAP[completedWrite]` (deduped
 *      across writes since a swap + save might both want
 *      `balance_check`), call `tool.call({}, toolContext)`. The empty
 *      input lets each tool default `address` to the wallet from
 *      `toolContext` — matches the engine's internal-injection shape.
 *
 *   3. Return `DispatchedReadPart[]` in the SAME shape as
 *      `dispatchIntentsToParts` so the chat route can merge results
 *      and reuse the existing step-0 wire-emission code path.
 *
 * The result: refresh reads ride the same `synthesizeAssistantToolMessage`
 * → `convertToModelMessages` path as intent-dispatched reads, which
 * means the LLM sees them as already-done history (Anthropic
 * `[tool_use, tool_result]` pair) and the client renders the cards
 * immediately. Identical wire shape, identical narration outcome to
 * the engine's internal mechanism.
 *
 * --- WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO (deferred) ---
 *
 * - Auto-execute writes (web-v2 doesn't do auto-tier writes today;
 *   when it does, A.5's `permissionConfig` + this module's same
 *   detection path fires for those too, no new code needed).
 * - Bundle resumes (multi-write Payment Intents). The bundle steps
 *   land as separate `output-available` parts on the resume turn —
 *   this module dedupes the refresh set across all of them and
 *   pre-fires once per refresh tool, which matches the engine's
 *   bundle-resume semantics.
 * - Tracking which tools have been refreshed THIS turn to avoid
 *   double-firing if the same write appears multiple times. Today
 *   AI SDK's resume turn assembly produces one `output-available`
 *   part per write — no double-fire risk.

/**
 * Scan the LAST assistant message's parts for write tools whose
 * client-side execution just succeeded. Returns `{toolName}` entries
 * keyed by the original WRITE tool (NOT the refresh-target read).
 *
 * Why "last assistant message" specifically: AI SDK's
 * `lastAssistantMessageIsCompleteWithToolCalls` predicate only fires
 * the resume turn when every tool part on the LAST assistant message
 * is in `output-available` or `output-error` state. So that one
 * message is the canonical source of all this-turn's HITL outcomes
 * (same convention as `extractResumeOutcomes` for cross-turn
 * TurnMetrics updates).
 *
 * **Confirmed-only filter:** we require `state === 'output-available'`
 * AND `approval.approved === true`. Denied writes (`approval.approved
 * === false`) and failed writes (`state === 'output-error'`) didn't
 * change on-chain state — refreshing would surface unchanged data and
 * burn a Prisma/BlockVision round-trip for no narration benefit.
 *
 * Read-only auto-tier writes (none today in web-v2; future state when
 * A.5's sub-threshold auto-execute lands) have NO `approval.id` set.
 * For those the LLM never paused, the tool just executed inline — we
 * still need to refresh after auto-tier writes, so this function
 * accepts both HITL-approved AND auto-executed write parts. Match
 * heuristic: the part's toolName is a key in `POST_WRITE_REFRESH_MAP`
 * AND state is `output-available`.
 *
 * Returns `[]` when no eligible writes are found (read-only turn,
 * text-only resume, all writes denied/failed).
